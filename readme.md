## Currently under development ##

This plugin is currently in beta version with core functionality complete and ready for testing. The base grid template is fully implemented and operational. The plugin is not yet recommended for production environments.

Additional template views, including a calendar interface for events and a Google Maps integration for venues/locations, are currently in active development. These templates will be included in upcoming releases.

We recommend using this plugin in testing or staging environments until a stable release is available.

## Description

Swiper Gallery is a Gutenberg WordPress block that displays posts, custom post types, and other content in interactive tabbed layouts. The block shows the same collection of posts across multiple tabs, with each tab presenting a different visual template and presentation style.

Developed for events and venues management, Swiper Gallery includes display options such as grid views, calendar layouts, and geolocated map interfaces—all within a single block. Visitors can switch between different visualization methods for the same content.

The block features a query builder and template system that allows for organizing and displaying content in multiple formats, each appropriate to different contexts.

The block includes a comprehensive query builder with support for post types, taxonomies, multiple term selection, meta query filters (with AND/OR logic, comparison operators, and data types), and various sorting options.

### Key Features:

- **Multiple Tab Layouts**: Create and customize multiple tabs, each with its own display template and settings
- **Advanced Query Builder**: Filter posts by type, taxonomy, multiple terms, and order
- **WIP: Meta Query Support**: Advanced filtering using custom fields (post metadatas and ACF fields). Choose metafields related to a post type and build complex queries.
- **Template Variations**: Choose different display templates for your posts : grid, slider, calendar (events), map (venues)
- **Customizable Options**: Control excerpt length, display of dates, authors, categories, and more
- **Material UI Interface**: Modern, responsive design powered by Material UI components
- **Dynamic Loading**: Load posts without page reload for better user experience
- **Calendar template** : Display Events and Venues in a day/week/month fullscreen calendar. Preview each post.
- **Google Map template** : Display Places and Venues on Google Map with custom markers.
